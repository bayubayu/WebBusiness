WebBusiness - Responsive multi purpose wordpress theme

## About

This is a wordpress template designed and created by me at 2014. The initial goal was creating modern looking theme but still backward compatible with old 
browser/IE 6. 
i was naively thinking that supporting ie6 can be a selling point, So i believed there were still a market for theme like this and i 
tried to publish this theme on the template marketplace. But you guess it. nobody cared about ie6 anymore. rejected.

What i learned: Everyone knows that supporting IE6 is hard.. but it even harder to push modern stuff (eg: responsive design, retina display, etc) and keep it backward compatible with it.
Too many time spent on bug fixing and finding a compromise.

This theme is intended to be lightweight and easy to setup & customize. It has no dependency to any 3rd party css framework.

I released it as open source. Along with PSD design and documentation. Enjoy!.
